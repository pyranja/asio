asio
====

asio is a HTTP based service platform for access to relational databases. It is used to host
datasets in the [VPH-Share](http://vph-share.eu/) cloud. asio provides

 * a SQL query endpoint
 * a [SPARQL Protocol](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/)endpoint based on [D2R](http://d2rq.org/)
 * metadata from the [VPH repository](http://vphshare.atosresearch.eu/)

Getting started
---------------

$h3 Requirements

 * [Java 7](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk7/)
 * [MySQL database](http://dev.mysql.com/)

$h3 Quick start
 
 * Download the [current release](http://elvira.par.univie.ac.at/archiva/repository/internal/at/ac/univie/isc/asio-distribution/${site-version}/asio-distribution-${site-version}.rpm) and install it.
 * Edit the settings in `/etc/sysconfig/asio` and `/var/local/asio` and start the asio service `service asio start`.
 * Execute `/usr/local/bin/asio <your_dataset_name> </path/to/d2r-mapping.ttl>` to deploy an asio instance.
 * Open `http://<host_and_port>/<your_dataset_name>/read/explore/sql.html` to start browsing your data.
